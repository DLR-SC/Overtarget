== Purpose
Overtarget is a feature that is supposed to help you with the creation and 
handling of target platform definitions in eclipse.

If you have an eclipse project which is based on other projects, 
you most likely have similar contents in the target definition files. 
When you are changing dependencies in the base project, you often have to change them in both files.

Overtarget lets you define your dependencies in a textual .tmodel file. 
Every change is directly compiled into a standard .target file. 
Similar to inheritance of classes you can create another .tmodel file for some other project 
and derive from the previous one. 
This way you only have to specify the changes, such as added, changed or removed dependencies. 
All other dependencies are inherited and compiled into the local .target file.

This documentation should help you getting familiar with Overtarget and its functionalities. 

== Requirements
Overtarget is based on Java / Eclipse and provides an installable feature with plug-ins for 
your personal eclipse IDE. The following infrastructure is required:


* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8
* Eclipse Oxygen or newer
** Including Checkstyle
** Including Spotbugs
** Including M2E
* Maven 3
* Windows 7 or Linux Computer


== Creating a tmodel file
In an existing project create a new file and add the file extension ".tmodel".

=== Writing a tmodel file

[cols="35a,65a"]
|===

|A tmodel file starts with the keyword "Target" followed by the name of the tmodel. 
Within the curly brackets you can define your tmodel the way you like. 
A target file is automatically generated when saving the tmodel file.

|===

TIP: Using content assist (ctrl + spacebar) will suggest the next possible keywords/steps.



=== Extending/Importing a tmodel file
It is possible to extend a tmodel by using the keyword "extends". That is especially useful for downstream projects which 
use the same dependencies as their main project in a tmodel. When there are changes in the tmodel of the main 
project, the tmodel of the downstream project which extends the main tmodel obtains these changes automatically.
A parent target hands down all of its content to the inheriting target, including operating system, windowing system and so on.

The same principle is applicable when importing a tmodel, using the keyword "Import". 
Imported targets only pass repository locations on to the inheriting targets.





== Generating a target file

=== Saving the tmodel file
A target file can be generated in different ways. The easiest way would be by saving
the tmodel file. The Overtarget generator then automatically generates a target file.

NOTE: Generating a target file by saving the tmodel file only works when changes have been applied.

=== Using the button/context menu "Generate Target"
[cols="50a,50a"]
|===

|Another option to generate a target is using the button "Generate Target" in the editor toolbar or in the context menu. 
A target file will be generated, also when no changes have been applied to the tmodel file. |

== Setting a target file as active target
[options=unbreakable]
[cols="35a,65a"]
|===

|There are different ways to set a target as active target in eclipse. 
The usual way is to open the target file which opens the eclipse target editor. Here you can click on "Set as Active Target Platform".

However, Overtarget serves you with a much more comfortable option to set a target.
If you want to set your target directly from the tmodel editor you can use the button "Set as Active Target" in the editor toolbar 
or in the context menu. The target will be automatically loaded and set as the active target platform. |

== Other useful stuff
=== Solving unresolved references in a tmodel
Sometimes when extending or importing another target, Eclipse cannot always resolve the references 
and shows errors in the tmodel file. It is not possible to generate a target with unresolved references. 
Overtarget solves the problem by generating a targetForReferences. This target includes the repository locations 
which lead to the unresolved references. By setting this target as active target, the references are 
then resolved. In order to generate a targetForReferences, the repositoryLocation to the 
referenced target has to be added with the keyword "ReferencedTarget".

[cols="62a,40a"]
|===

|There is a quick fix which suggests to generate a targetForReferences. 
Executing that quick fix will generate a targetForReferences. 
The target will also be set as an active target to resolve all references. |

|===

Now there should no longer be problems with unresolved references in the actual target. It can now be generated 
without complications and then be set as the active target platform. 

NOTE: If there are still unresolved references, please check if you need to add dependencies to the manifest file.

=== Updating versions

[cols="50a,50a"]
|===
| Another nice feature Overtarget provides, is updating the versions of units in a repository location 
automatically in the tmodel file. To do that, you have to select the entire line of a unit with its 
version and then either click the button "Update Versions" in the toolbar or use the context menu. 
If there is a newer version available, it will be updated.

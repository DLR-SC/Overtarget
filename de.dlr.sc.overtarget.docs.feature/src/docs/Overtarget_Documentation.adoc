== Introduction
Overtarget is an eclipse plug-in that helps you managing your target platform files 
with dependencies across project boundaries.

This documentation should help you getting familiar with Overtarget and its functionalities. 

== Creating a tmodel file
In an existing project create a new file and add the file extension ".tmodel".

=== Writing a tmodel file

[cols="35,~"]
|===

|A tmodel file always starts with the keyword "Target" followed by the name of the tmodel. 
Within the curly brackets you can define your tmodel the way you like. 
A target file is automatically generated when saving the tmodel file.

An example tmodel is presented below. |

TIP: Using content assist (ctrl + spacebar) will suggest the next possible keywords/steps.


=== Extending/Importing a tmodel file
It is possible to extend a tmodel by using the keyword "extends". That is especially useful for downstream projects which 
use the same dependencies as their main project in a tmodel. When a main project makes changes in a the tmodel,
the tmodel of the downstream project which extends the main tmodel obtains these changes automatically.

The same principle is applicable when importing a tmodel, using the keyword "Import".




== Generating a target file

=== Saving the tmodel file
A target file can be generated in different ways. The easiest way would be by saving
the tmodel file. The Overtarget generator then automatically generates a target file.

NOTE: Generating a target file by saving the tmodel file only works when changes were made.

=== Using the button/context menu "Generate Target"
[cols="50,50"]
|===

|Another option to generate a target is using the button in the editor toolbar or in the context menu "Generate Target". 
A target file will be generated, also when no changes have been applied to the tmodel file. |

== Setting a target file as active target
[cols="35,65"]
|===

|There are different ways to set a target as active target in eclipse. 
The usual way is to open the target file which opens the eclipse target editor. Here you can click on "Set as Active Target Platform".
However, Overtarget serves you with a much more comfortable option to set a target.
If you want to set your target directly from the tmodel editor you can use the button "Set as Active Target" in the editor toolbar 
or in the context menu. The target will be automatically loaded and set as the active target platform. |

== Other useful stuff
=== Solving unresolved references in a tmodel
Sometimes when extending or importing another target, Eclipse cannot resolve the references and shows errors.
It is not possible to generate a target with unresolved references. 
Overtarget solves the problem by generating a targetForReferences. This target includes the repository locations 
which lead to the unresolved references. By setting this target as active target, the references are then resolved. In order to generate a targetForReferences, the repositoryLocation to the unresolved target has to be added with the keyword "ReferencedTarget".

[cols="62a,40a"]
|===

|There is a quick fix which suggests to generate a targetForReferences. Executing that quick fix will generate a targetForReferences. The target will also be set as an active Target to resolve all references. |

_Generate targetForReferences_

|===

Now there should no longer be problems with unresolved references in the actual target. It can now be generated 
without complications and then be set as the active target platform. 

NOTE: If there are still errors, please check if you need to add dependencies to the manifest file.

=== Updating versions

== Some last words

Overtarget is still in development. So if you have any ideas, how to improve the handling with target platforms, please let us know. The easiest way to do that, is to add an issue in github. We are happy to consider your suggestions.

== Creating a tmodel file
In an existing project create a new file and add the file extension "tmodel".

=== Writing a tmodel file
A tmodel file always starts with the keyword "Target" followed by the name of the tmodel. 
Within the curly brackets you can define your tmodel the way you like. 
A target file is automatically generated when saving the tmodel file.

An example tmodel is presented below.

Using content assist (ctrl + spacebar) will suggest the next possible keywords/steps.

=== Extending/Importing a tmodel file
It is possible to extend a tmodelby using the keyword "extends". That is especially useful for downstream projects which 
use the same infrastructure like the main projects in a tmodel. When a main project makes changes in a the tmodel,
the tmodel of the downstream project which extends the main tmodel obtains these changes automatically.

The same principle is applicable when importing a tmodel, using the keyword "Import".

Overtarget is an eclipse plug-in that helps you managing your target platform files 
with dependencies across project boundaries.

This documentation should help you getting familiar with Overtarget and its functionalities. 

== Creating a tmodel file
In an existing project create a new file and add the file extension ".tmodel".

=== Writing a tmodel file
A tmodel file always starts with the keyword "Target" followed by the name of the tmodel. 
Within the curly brackets you can define your tmodel the way you like. 
A target file is automatically generated when saving the tmodel file.

An example tmodel is presented below.

TIP: Using content assist (ctrl + spacebar) will suggest the next possible keywords/steps.


=== Extending/Importing a tmodel file
It is possible to extend a tmodel by using the keyword "extends". That is especially useful for downstream projects which 
use the same dependencies as their main project in a tmodel. When a main project makes changes in a the tmodel,
the tmodel of the downstream project which extends the main tmodel obtains these changes automatically.

The same principle is applicable when importing a tmodel, using the keyword "Import".




== Generating a target file

=== Saving the tmodel file
A target file can be generated in different ways. The easiest way would be by saving
the tmodel file. The Overtarget generator then automatically generates a target file.

NOTE: Generating a target file by saving the tmodel file only works when changes were made.

=== Using the button/context menu "Generate Target"
Another option to generate a target is using the button in the editor toolbar or in the context menu "Generate Target". 
A target file will be generated, also when no changes have been applied to the tmodel file.
